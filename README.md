# Book Trader

Book Trader is an application that allows users to set up and maintain a book sharing library. Users can search for the books they own using the Google Books API and add them to the library. Other users can view the books in the library and request to borrow books from the original owner.

## To Use

Sign up by entering your email address and a password. Once logged in, you may edit your profile, add a book, or view the library. To add a book, enter your book title into the search field and click the 'Search' button. Choose the result that looks best, and click the 'Add book' button. Now your book is available to view in the library and others can request to borrow it. To request a book, go to the Library and click the 'Request Book' button for whichever book you want to borrow and the owner will be notified.
